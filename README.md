## 🔄 How It Works

```
User registers / logs in
        ↓
Selects a doctor + date + time
        ↓
System checks for double-booking
        ↓
Appointment saved with status: Booked
        ↓
User can update (reschedule) or cancel
        ↓
Status updates to: Cancelled
```

## 🧠 Key Django Concepts Used

| Concept | Where Used |
|---------|-----------|
| `ForeignKey` | Appointment linked to User and Doctor |
| `on_delete=CASCADE` | Deleting a user removes their appointments |
| `choices` field | Appointment status (Booked / Completed / Cancelled) |
| Django Auth | Built-in User model for login/register |
| Django Admin | Manage doctors and appointments |
| Template rendering | All UI via Django HTML templates |
| ORM queries | `filter()`, `get()` for fetching appointments |

---

## 🔒 Business Logic

- A user can only **see their own appointments** (`filter(user=request.user)`)
- **Double booking is blocked** — same doctor + date + time raises a validation error
- **Completed appointments cannot be rescheduled** — status check in the update view
- Cancellation changes status to `Cancelled` instead of deleting the record (better for audit trails)

---

## 🚧 Upcoming Improvements

- [ ] Convert to REST API using Django REST Framework (DRF)
- [ ] Add React or Next.js frontend
- [ ] Email confirmation on booking
- [ ] Doctor availability time slot validation
- [ ] Pagination on appointments list
- [ ] Deploy to Railway / Render
